## Overview

This project implement the Minimax Alpha-beta Pruning algorithm with Python, the example is shown as below.


## Intorduction

The problem is considered as the game tree with 3 more moves.
It is needed to identify the branches that can be pruned in the game tree using Minimax Alpha-beta Pruning.

However, the example contains the three layers with diffent set, each set consists of three nodes.
